//JavaScript Operators are symbols used to perform specific mathematical, comparison, assignment, and logical computations on operands.

// JavaScript Arithmetic Operators:
/*
1. Addition (+) =>  Y = “Geeks” + “for” + “Geeks” gives , Y = “GeeksforGeeks” Y
2. Subtraction (-) => Y = 5 – 3 gives, Y = 2
3. Multiplication (*) => Y = 5 * 5 gives, Y = 25
4. Division (/) => Y = 5 / 5 gives, Y = 1
5. Modulus (%) => Modulus ‘%’ operator gives a remainder of an integer division. A % B means remainder (A/B) Y = 5 % 4 gives, Y = 1
6. Exponentiation (**) => Y = 5 ** 3 gives, Y = 125
7. Increment(++) => let A = 10 and Y = A + + then A = 11, Y=10
8. Decrement (–-) => let A = 10 and Y = A – – then, A = 9 Y=10
9. Unary (+) => +a means a is a positive number
10. Negation (-) => -a means a is a negative number
*/

// JavaScript Assignment Operators:
/*
1. Assignment (=) => If A = 10 and Y = A then Y = 10
2. Addition Assignment (+=) => Y += 1 gives Y = Y + 1
3. Subtraction Assignment (-=) => Y -= 1 gives Y = Y – 1
4. Multiplication Assignment (*=) => Y *= A is equivalent to Y = Y * A
5. Division Assignment (/=) => Y /= A is equivalent to Y = Y / A
6. Modules/Remainder Assignment (%=) => Y %= A is equivalent to Y = Y % A
7. Exponentiation Assignment (**=) =>Y **= A is equivalent to Y=Y ** A
8. Left Shift Assignment (<<=) => Y <<= A is equivalent to Y=Y << A
9. Right Shift Assignment (>>=) => Y >>= A is equivalent to Y = Y >> A
10. Bitwise AND Assignment (&=) => Y &= b is equivalent to Y = Y & A
11. Bitwise OR Assignment (|=) => Y |= A is equivalent to Y= Y | b
12. Bitwise XOR Assignment (^=) => Y ^= A is equivalent to Y= Y ^ A
*/

// JavaScript Comparison Operators
/*
1. Equality (==) => Y = 5 and X = 6 Y = = X is false.
2. Strict equality (===) => Y = 5 and X = ‘5’ Y = = = X is false. (data and datatypes both are same)
3. Inequality (!=) => let X = 10 then X ! = 11 is true.
4. Strict inequality (!==) => let X = 10 then X ! == ’10’ is true.
5. Greater than (>) => let X = 10 then X > 11 is false.
6. Less than (<) => let X = 10 then X < 11 is true.
7. Greater than or Equal to (>=) => let X = 10 then X > = 11 is false.
8. Less than or Equal to (<= ) => let X = 10 then X < = 10 is true.
*/

// JavaScript Logical Operators
/*
1. Logical AND (&&) => Y = 5 and X = 6 Y && X is 6.
2. Logical OR (||) => Y = 5 and X = 0 Y || X is 5.
3. Logical NOT (!) => Y = 5 and X = 0 !(Y || X) is false.
*/

// JavaScript Ternary Operators: The ternary operator has three operands. It is the simplified operator of if/else.
/*
Ternary Operator (?:) => Y = ? A : B If the condition is true then Y = A otherwise Y = B
*/

//JavaScript Comma Operators
/*
Comma Operator (,) mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand. 
*/

// JavaScript Unary Operators: A unary operation is an operation with only one operand.
/*
1. Typeof => typeof variable
2. Delete => delete object // or delete object.property  // or delete object[‘property’]
*/

// JavaScript Relational Operators: JavaScript Relational operators are used to compare its operands and determine the relationship between them.
/*
1. IN => propNameOrNumber in objectName
2. instanceof => objectName instanceof objectType
*/

// JavaScript BigInt Operators : It returns a new BigInt object that represents the original value.
/*
BigInt => BigInt(value);
*/

// JavaScript String Operators: 
/*
concatenation operator (+) => str1 + str2
*/

//Operator precedence in JavaScript
/*
( * ) and ( / ) have higher precedence than ( + ) and ( - )
