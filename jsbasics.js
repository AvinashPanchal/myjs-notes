/*
JavaScript can be added to HTML file in two ways:
1. Internal JS: 
In this approach, you place JavaScript code directly within the <script> tags in the <head> or <body> section of your HTML page.
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>

2. External JS:
We can write JavaScript code in another files having an extension.js and then link this file inside the <head> tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.
<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js">
